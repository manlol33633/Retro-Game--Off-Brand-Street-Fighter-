i think by default (as in we do this first, if we have time we do more)
we should on start spawn in the two characters, we can make them ryu/ken
add SIMPLE combat, as in you can light attack, heavy attack, and block- no animation windows or anything (Add parries later)
after it actually works (getting hit does damage) we can add special attacks (different multiplier damage)
then add actual movement so you can run back and forth
thoughts?
